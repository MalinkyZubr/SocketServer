ADD CONNECTION TABLES FOR THE CLIENT TO IDENTIFY CONNECTIONS AND SEND DATA MORE EFFICIENTLY THROUGH THE SERVER. ADD A SYSTEM SO THAT THE SERVER WILL RETURN EXCEPTION TO CLIENT THAT TRIES TO SEND MESSAGE TO CLIENT THAT IS NO LONGER OR WAS NEVER CONNECTEd. OPTIMIZE THE CLIENT TABLES.

for all socket opts:
FOr server:
Consider creating a config class to store configuration settings and use it in __init__ instead of hardcoding them as function parameters.
Use type hints in function signatures to improve code readability.
Use more descriptive variable names.
Consider splitting the code into smaller functions to make it easier to maintain and test.
When raising exceptions, use specific exceptions instead of a generic one like Exception.
Use a more secure password hashing library like bcrypt instead of the simple hashlib.
Use the if __name__ == '__main__' idiom to write a test script for the code.
use more secure ssl encryption

for client:
Use the logging module's exception method to log any exceptions that might occur.

Consider breaking down the connect_to_server method into smaller methods that can be easily unit tested.

Don't use os._exit(). Instead, raise an exception that can be caught and handled.

You can also add comments to describe the logic of your code.

for exceptions:
Consider adding optional parameters to the __init__ method to allow for more customized error messages.
Consider documenting the purpose and usage of each exception class.
