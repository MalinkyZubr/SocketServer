too much schema bloat! simplify schema operations immediately!!!

make it easier for users to send messages to either server or client

for all socket opts:
make a unified protocol to do ssl wrappings, so that there is not such a large amount of errors when improving SSL functionality.
FOr server:
Use a more secure password hashing library like bcrypt instead of the simple hashlib.
use more secure ssl encryption

for client:
Use the logging module's exception method to log any exceptions that might occur.

Consider breaking down the connect_to_server method into smaller methods that can be easily unit tested.

Don't use os._exit(). Instead, raise an exception that can be caught and handled.

You can also add comments to describe the logic of your code.

add standardized commands for the client to make operations easier

add a way to filter what is done with received messages based on their origin

standardize how the client communicates directly with the server, schema simplification

for exceptions:
Consider adding optional parameters to the __init__ method to allow for more customized error messages.

for schemas:
